            <p> 1. Learnability: How long it takes to participants to know the functionalities of Mi Band<br>
              2. Efficiency: How quickly to participants to use those functionalities.<br>
              3. Memorability: After experiment, if participants can remember how to use this device effectively in the future.<br>
              4. Errors: How many errors occurred while using the mi band 2, if the errors are essential, are they able to fix the errors by themselves?<br>
              5. Satisfaction: If the participants like the device, are they going to buy the device, are they going to introduce this device to their friend? </p>

            <h4>Design Principles</h4>
            <p>Based on Gould & Lewis(1985), most of the usability of designing for a product or a system, they prefer to focus on three design principles which early concentrate on the users, tasks and empirical measurement, iterative design. Therefore, the products or systems (MI band) must be easily used for users. Users can use less time to learn, and remember how to use it and what useful for them.</p>

            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>Usability is the key elements of a product as talked before. Usability Testing is extremely important to make sure the usability of the product. “it is very important to verify that when the product goes through human interaction, that it is achieving their objective or goal.” (Redd Horrocks, 2009). When we doing the usability testing we need to ensure the participants have different age, sex and personality. In this experiment, we used privately observed usability test. We left the Mi band 2 to participants and recorded. At the end, we observed their actions and motions. We also encouraged them to tell our researcher about what they are thinking about the device. Therefore, we can get their reaction to the product.</p>

          <div class="col-md-9">
            <h4>Individual Interview</h4>
            <p>In order to directly get what participant first impression of the product. “An individual interview allows you to probe their attitudes, beliefs, desires, and experiences to get a deeper understanding of the users who come to your site” (Individual Interviews, n.d.). In this research, we will have an individual interview to ask participant what are they thinking about the mi band 2. Is it looking good? Are they interested in this mi band? And more questions about the device.</p>

            <h4>Approach for analyzing data</h4>
            <p>The researchers are collecting information from the primary information from the research activities. And then analyze the information. After that, the researcher examines the data which they received, and then according to results they investigated, the research can determine whether there is any may indicate a pattern or support the general theory of correlation it from the data collection, classification, and then develop a theory or hypothesis.” The inductive analysis refers to approaches that primarily use accurate reading s of raw data to derive concepts, themes, or a model through interpretations made from raw data by an evaluator or researcher”(Thomas, 2006). “Purely inductive research, undertaken with no preconceived ideas to direct one’s attention while observing, is impossible or put us into a state of “blooming, buzzing, confusion.” (Vogt, Garden, Haeffele & Vogt, 2014). All research activities undertaken by combined analyzing approaches seem more professional.</p>

        <h4>Participant Information Sheet</h4>
        <p>The table above displays a serial of results that tested by participants. From row 2 to
          row 5 are results collected by group members and row 6 are issues we found out
          during the experiment.<br>
          As per the chart, we could notice that first participant used 22 seconds to set up the
          device as the participant did not know the correct way to install all components. The
          second participant used more than 1 minute to find out how to check the history data
          and said it is not easy to use. Meanwhile, the third participant had no major issue
          with the Mi Band, but he suggests the device should have more interaction
          notification on the App screen. For the fourth participant, the participant was not
          satisfied with how to play with the dial, find out where the touch button is and what
          functions the Mi Band provides, so the user failed to complete specific tasks.<br>
          We have found that the last user was angry during the test, and the user is also given
          feedback that he is not enjoying the fitness tracker device. As a result, we need to
          consider that the user’s interest will impact the user experience as well.</p>
        <h4>A vibration is easy to get attention from user</h4>
        <p>Based on user’s experience, we found that the Mi Band has a gentle vibration
          module within the device. When the user is using the MI Band, it uses senses of
          touch and sound to interact with the human. For wearable devices, especially a
          fitness tracker, people may forget or miss essential messages and callings when
          your phone is tucked away in a bag or pocket while doing outside exercises.
          However, the user would not miss out any alerts or notification from the vibration and
          buzz.</p>
        <h4>Foolproof design used in charger</h4>
        <p>Moreover, the design of Mi Band’s charger is also impressed by user’s feedback. The
          user can easily find out where the charge port is and plug the device directly. The
          user can quickly identify the direction from the visual because the charger has metal
          port and is structurally correct while plugging.</p>
        <h4>Disadvantages/Issues:</h4>
        <p>Firstly, most of the participants can install all the components but not a correct way to set up. In other words, the accurate method to set up the device is installing the
          device from the bottom of the wrist strap instead of starting from the top. Although it
          does not affect the use, it might be time-consuming regarding figuring out the correct
          way to install all components, and it would confuse the user.<br>
          The second issue is most of the participant cannot navigate to the home page after
          the device is first connected. Also, the same problem happened when the user is
          trying to set up alarm. It seems some operation prompts animation is missing for the
          first-time users.<br>
          And last is all participant touched the screen while they are exploring and paring the
          device. But in this situation, we might consider this is a part of self-learning process.
          It might be clearer if the user knows that this is not a touchscreen before the test
          start.</p>
        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <p>In conclusion, the majority of our participants were satisfied with the Mi Band even
          there are a few of drawbacks and might affect the user’s experience. From user’s
          perspective, the device is achieved the necessary steps count and heart rate
          monitoring requirements. Besides, it can remind the user not to miss the incoming
          calls and messages. Finally, they are all praising the design of charger that is easy to
          use, and they can directly use it.</p>
        <h4>Improvement:</h4>
        <p>Concerning design, we suggest that the designer can try to redesign the structure of
          dial and wrist strap. It would be better to let the user directly use the device rather
          than read from the user manual. To improving the user interface of the app, add
          some operation prompts animation to guide the user.<br>
          Also, we recommend that the Mi Band should think about how to show their user
          manual as we found out our participants did not read the user manual during the
          experiment so that they were confused about some functions such as how to set up
          alarm and turn on lazy mode.</p>
